# WritePad
Notepad made using Tkinter in Python
As we all may or may not be aware of the fact that Python is a "general purpose language", it means we can use Python to develop various applications for various platforms.
Tkinter is a GUI library from Python from which we can create multiple GUI applications. Here, using tkinter I have developed a notepad like text editor.
The notepad (WritePad) has menu functionality where we can create new file, open existing file, save the file, editing, cut and paste, all functionality is present here.
Pre-requisites:
Python installed
Tkinter installed (Tkinter comes as a standard library with Python 3 and above)
